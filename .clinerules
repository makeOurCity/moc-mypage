# Important Rules for Code Changes

## 1. Commit Practices
- When a task is completed and ready to report to the user, commit the source code changes.
- Before starting any work, check the status of changes using `git status`.
- For large-scale changes, consult with the user before proceeding.

## 2. Testing Requirements
- All tests must be executed and passed before committing any changes.
- Run the complete test suite to ensure overall system stability.

## 3. Error Handling
- If any test fails consecutively 5 times or more, stop and consult with the user.
- Report persistent test failures to get user guidance on how to proceed.

# Test Execution Process

I will execute tests using the following command:
```
npm run test:ai
```

The testing process follows these steps:
1. First, run tests focused on the implemented components.
2. Once these targeted tests pass, proceed with running the complete test suite for comprehensive validation.
